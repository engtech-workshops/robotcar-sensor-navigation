# JetAuto Robotics Workshop

Welcome to the **JetAuto Robotics Workshop**!  
In this hands-on session, you'll learn:

1. **How cars move** – Understanding 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive systems, turning, and steering mechanisms.
2. **HiWonder JetAuto setup** – Getting your JetAuto ready for action.
3. **Manual control** – Drive the JetAuto directly.
4. **Open-loop control** – Moving without sensor feedback.
5. **Sensor-based turning** – Let the JetAuto detect and respond to corners.
6. **Maze challenge** – Test your skills in real navigation scenarios.
7. **Autonomous navigation** – Introduction to SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
