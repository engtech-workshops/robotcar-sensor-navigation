# Maze Navigation Challenge

Weâ€™ll combine our skills for a fun test.

## Maze Layout

Investigate maze B. 

### Challenge 1: Open-loop control

Without using sensor, using only timing to move the JetAuto, navigate from the entry point to the exit point.

### Challenge 2: Sensor-assisted

Using the sensor to detect the wall, navigate the JetAuto from the entry point to the exit point.
