# Manual Driving

Manual driving helps you understand the responsiveness of JetAuto.


## Objective
Drive JetAuto manually using the PS2 controller.


## Steps
1. Make sure the PS2 controller is connected to the JetAuto.

2. If not, turn off the PS2 controller, wait for a few seconds, then turn on the controller again. If it's still not connected, talk to the instructor.

3. Familiarise yourself with the operation of JetAuto using the PS2 controller. (Hint: the JetAuto is controlled by the two joysticks on the controller)

# Extra

You may notice that JetAuto allows the "shifting" motions to go in four different directions. This is due to JetAuto using the mecanum wheels. You may refer to [this](https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/zeus-car-dev/en/latest/scratch/sc4_move_wheels.html) for explanation of mecanum wheels movement.
